* TODOlist items take from the source code:
** TODO textbox: Text selection    
** TODO textbox: Simple syntax highlighting (requires meta data)
** TODO textbox: append killed region if last command was also a kill
** TODO button: Add CBARGS to callback
** TODO canvas: self.contents should be some sort of spatial hash
** TODO canvas.add(): perhaps just calculate the new items' position rather than set positions_are_dirty
** TODO canvas.remove(): perhaps just calculate the items' positions after the removed item rather than set positions_are_dirty
** TODO engine: there's a window/root widget trapped in here
** TODO util.blit_text: I would prefer objects... with editable text.
** TODO util.blit_text: Store list of text, and only rerender when it changes
** TODO widget: go from data structures to GUI
** TODO widget: create a proxy surface/view handler
** TODO widget: Split out the flow-based container stuck inside here
** TODO widget: allow for styling/themes (inherit theme from parent.)
** TODO widget.add: perhaps just calculate the new items' position rather than set positions_are_dirty
** TODO widget.remove: perhaps just calculate the new items' after positions rather than set positions_are_dirty
